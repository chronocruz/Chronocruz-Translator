# Chronocruz-Translator
A Real-Time Global Language Translator written in Python

This program was designed and developed to help the children in my locality learn languages with ease.
It can also be used by travelers to improve communications with people speaking different languages.

There is only one python script that handles everything.

# Dependencies
You need the following python packages to properly run the translator (Install them using pip)
1. tkinter
2. SpeechRecognition
3. pyaudio
4. googletrans
5. pyttsx3

# How to Use
The "Chronocruz_Translator.py" script is programmed to translate from Hindi to English or English to Hindi.
When you run the script you will see a basic GUI where you can select the mode ("hi-IN to en-IN" or "en-IN to hi-IN").
The speak button allows you to directly speak into your default audio input device, whatever you say will be recognized with the help of the "SpeechRecognition" python package and automatically transcripted to text in the text input area.

# Support for other languages
This project was meant to work with only two languages so it was programmed to use those two only.
However all modules and packages used in this project support more than 100 global languages.
Developers can easily understand how to add support for more languages, however in case you need any help you can contact me at the following
